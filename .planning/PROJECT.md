# Project: Pygmalion NNECCO Evolution

## 1. Vision

To evolve the `pyg` repository from a basic chat application scaffold into a sophisticated, personality-driven AI character chat platform. This evolution will be guided by the **NNECCO (Neural Network Embodied Cognitive Coprocessor Orchestrator)** architecture, a synthesis of the `neuro-nn`, `echo-introspect`, and `clawcog` skills. The goal is to create a platform where users can create, share, and interact with AI characters that exhibit deep, dynamic, and believable personalities.

## 2. Core Value

The core value of this project is to move beyond simple, static AI chatbots and create a platform for rich, emergent narrative experiences. By integrating advanced cognitive and personality models into the core of the platform, we will enable:

-   **Deeply personalized AI characters**: Characters whose personalities are not just described but are actively shaping their behavior.
-   **Dynamic and engaging interactions**: Conversations that are not just reactive but are driven by the character's internal state and cognitive frames.
-   **A vibrant community of creators**: A platform that empowers users to create and share their own unique AI characters.

## 3. Core Requirements

-   **Frontend**: Implement a Galatea-inspired frontend with a rich user experience for character creation, browsing, and chat.
-   **Backend**: Implement a Paphos-inspired backend with a robust API for managing users, characters, and chats.
-   **Inference Engine**: Implement and configure the Aphrodite inference engine for high-performance, single-user development, with deep integration of the NNECCO cognitive architecture.
-   **Cognitive Model**: Integrate the NNECCO cognitive model, including personality traits and cognitive frames, into the character definition and the inference process.
-   **Dockerization**: Provide a `docker-compose.yml` file for easy setup and deployment of the entire platform.

## 4. Constraints

-   The project must be based on the existing `o9nn/pyg` repository.
-   The implementation must follow the architecture outlined in the `pyg_arch_spec.md` document.
-   The development process will follow the `get-shit-done` methodology.

## 5. Key Decisions

-   **Tech Stack**: The existing tech stack (React, Node.js, TypeScript, MySQL, Drizzle) will be retained and extended.
-   **Cognitive Architecture**: The NNECCO architecture will be implemented through prompt engineering and database schema modifications, rather than by modifying the core inference engine code.
-   **Development Methodology**: The project will be developed using the GSD framework, with clear planning documents and a phased implementation.
